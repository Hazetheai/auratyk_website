      <p>
        The following disclaimer applies to all websites and the entire internet
        offer of the provider. If individual provisions of the following
        regulations are ineffective, the remaining regulations remain valid.
      </p>

      <h4 class="margin-top-xl margin-bottom-sm">LIABILITY FOR LINKS</h4>
      <p>
        Our offer may contain (hyper)links to third-party websites over whose
        content we have no influence. The respective provider or operator of the
        website is responsible for this third-party content. This also expressly
        applies to all entries by third parties to be found on the website and
        within the Internet offer, such as in guest forums set up by the
        provider. At the time of linking, the websites were checked for possible
        legal violations. Any illegal content could not be detected. However,
        the permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
        reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. As soon as we
        become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
      </p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-xl margin-bottom-sm">COPYRIGHT</h4>
      <p>
        The content and works created by the provider on these pages are subject
        to copyright. The duplication, editing, distribution and any kind of
        exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent
        of the respective author or creator. Insofar as the content on this site
        was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are
        observed.

      <h4 class="margin-top-xl margin-bottom-sm">PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
      <h4 class="margin-top-xl margin-bottom-sm">4.1 GENERAL</h4>
      <p>
        The use of our websites is generally possible without providing personal
        data. However, insofar as personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses)
        is collected on our website, this data is disclosed on a voluntary
        basis. Your personal data is collected and processed in accordance with
        the provisions of German data protection law. The personal data will not
        be passed on to third parties without your express consent. We would
        like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when
        communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection
        of the data against access by third parties is not possible.
      </p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-xl margin-bottom-sm">4.2 INFORMATION</h4>

        information about your stored data and, if necessary, a right to
        correction, blocking or deletion of this data. You can ask questions,
